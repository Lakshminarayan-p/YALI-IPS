# YALI-IPS

YALI (Yet Another Layer of Intrusion prevention) is a robust Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) designed to monitor, detect, and prevent malicious activities on a network. This project focuses on providing security for network traffic by analyzing packets, applying rules, and logging alerts.

## Features

- **Packet Inspection**: Analyze network packets to identify and block malicious activities.
- **Custom Rules**: Define custom rules for traffic filtering and anomaly detection.
- **Protocol Mapping**: Supports protocol mapping for more accurate packet analysis.
- **Logging**: Detailed logging of alerts and detected anomalies.
- **FTP and SSH Monitoring**: Specific modules for monitoring FTP and SSH traffic.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: The main entry point of the IPS.
- `process_packet.py`: Handles packet processing and inspection.
- `protocol_mapping.py`: Maps protocols to ensure accurate packet analysis.
- `iptables.py`: Manages IP tables for traffic filtering.
- `ftp_log.py`: Monitors and logs FTP traffic.
- `ssh_log.py`: Monitors and logs SSH traffic.
- `rules.txt`: Defines rules for packet inspection.
- `alerts_log.csv`: Logs of all alerts generated by the IPS.

## Requirements

### Programming Language:
- **Python**

### Python Libraries:
- **subprocess**: For spawning new processes and connecting to their input/output/error pipes.
- **re**: For regular expression matching operations.
- **collections**: For specialized data structures.
- **datetime**: For date and time manipulation.
- **csv**: For handling CSV file operations.
- **os**: For interacting with the operating system.
- **scapy**: For network packet manipulation and analysis.
- **threading**: For parallel execution of threads.
- **iptables**: For managing and configuring IP tables.

### Tools:
- **IPTables**: A command-line firewall utility that manages network traffic.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Lakshminarayan-p/YALI-IPS.git
    cd YALI-IPS
    ```

2. Install the necessary Python libraries:

    ```bash
    pip install scapy
    ```

3. Run the main script:

    ```bash
    python3 main.py
    ```

## Usage

- Customize the `rules.txt` file to define the behavior of the IPS.
- Monitor the `alerts_log.csv` file for any detected anomalies or attacks.
